# Machine Learning Skills Brush Up

In preparation for machine learning projects, I've recently revised my skills in NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. These are fundamental libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization in Python.

## NumPy
- Reinforced understanding of array manipulation and numerical computations.
- Reviewed functionalities for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.

## Pandas
- Refreshed knowledge on data manipulation and analysis with Pandas DataFrame.
- Practiced techniques for data cleaning, merging, and reshaping.

## Matplotlib
- Reviewed plotting functionalities to create insightful visualizations.
- Practiced creating various types of plots such as scatter plots, histograms, and line plots.

By revisiting these libraries, I aim to enhance my proficiency in handling data and visualizing insights, which are essential skills for successful machine learning endeavors.
